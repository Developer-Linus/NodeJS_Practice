# 1. JavaScript

    - **What it is**: A programming language used to create interactive and dynamic features on websites.
    - **Where it runs**: Initially designed to run only in web browsers.
    - What it does: It powers things like buttons, animations, form validations, and dynamic updates on web pages.
    Analogy: Think of JavaScript as the engine in a car — it makes things move and work.

# 2. Node.js

    - What it is: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside of a browser.
    - Where it runs: On a server (your computer or in the cloud).
    - What it does: Lets you use JavaScript to build server-side applications like web servers, tools, or APIs.
    - Analogy: If JavaScript is the engine, Node.js is like a standalone car you can drive anywhere — it makes JavaScript work in new places, not just the browser.

# 3. Express

    - What it is: A framework built on top of Node.js to make server-side coding simpler and faster.
    - Where it runs: Inside a Node.js environment.
    - What it does: It provides tools, shortcuts, and features for creating web servers, APIs, and handling tasks like routing (URLs) and middleware (extra processing for requests).
    - Analogy: If Node.js is the car, Express is like a GPS system or a map — it simplifies your journey and helps you get where you want to go faster.
